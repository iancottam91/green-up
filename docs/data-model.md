For now:

availability is very basic:

- have a userId
- have a date that they're available

Pros:

* Can post data to specify your availability
* Simple query to get all users available on a certain day
* Simple query to get all availability for a user

Cons:

* Not very scaleable
* Could have duplicates - build in validation to stop this later be extending the model?
